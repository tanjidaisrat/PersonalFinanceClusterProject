# 💰 Personal Finance Clustering Project

This project applies unsupervised machine learning (KMeans clustering) to personal finance transaction data to uncover behavioral patterns in spending habits. It also includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to input their own data and receive cluster predictions in real time.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Preprocess and analyze personal financial transaction data
- Identify distinct clusters of spending behavior using KMeans
- Deploy an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions
- Make personal finance insights more accessible through visualization and automation
